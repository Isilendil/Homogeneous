1.

classifier.alpha1 = alpha1;
classifier.alpha1 = alpha2;

In HomOTLf_K_M.m, HomOTL1_K_M.m and HomOTL2_K_M.m, alpha1 in classifier are assigned the value of alpha1, and then are assigned the value of alpha2.
However, alpha2 in classifier have no value.


2. 
t_tick = T_TICK

...

if t<T_TICK
    if (t==t_tick)
        ...
        if t_tick>=T_TICK
            t_tick = T_TICK
        end
    end
end

t_tick is equal to T_TICK, then there is no chance to run code in the next if-clause.
